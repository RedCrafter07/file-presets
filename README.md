# File Presets

Kinda self explanatory... An extension which provides file presets in a simple way

## Features

![feature 1](images/feature-1.png)
This extension will ask you if you want to apply a preset when a file is created. It's just that simple!

You can also force presets so you create a file and have it set up already. Cool, right?

## Extension Settings

### Conflict
This option tells the extension what to do when there are two matching presets for the current file (ending preset and normal preset)

### Ending Presets
If activated, ending presets will be available. When the extension found a matching file for the preset but you deactivated this option nothing will happen at all.

### File Presets
Same as ending presets but with file presets.

### Force Presets
If enabled, presets will be accepted automatically.

## Known Issues

No issues found yet!
